Savior Duck Mother(demo)

this is a demo of "Savior Duck Mother" - a pygame game made by me out of bore :V

the demo includes about 80% of the game, the missing parts are some sprites for background, victory screen, 
some sound effects and maybe an intro screen for the lore but I don't really have that much time.

download the zip file, unzip it and run the application file that all you need to play it. 
you can modify the sprites, audio as you wish but make sure it got the same name as original and maybe the same size, length for performance.

some bit of gameplay, you can unlock story mode after reaching 30 pts in endless mode, finishing the story mode and you win. 
you can fly up in the air and dive down in water, the only way you could get out of water is to wait for it to go down as it is faster than you, 
there are power up sometimes with side effects or easter egg and it will show in the wiki once you see them. That's it.

Here some keyboard shortcut if you prefer:

RIGHT ARROW: BACK

SPACE      : FLY / UNPAUSE

P          : ENDLESS MODE / PAUSE 

S          : SETTING / STAT

T          : STORY MODE

M          : MUTE / UNMUTE / MENU
